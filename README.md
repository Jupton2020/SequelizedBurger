# SequelizedBurger

Eat Da Burger (Sequelized) is a an app that allows a user to type in the names of burgers they'd like to eat and devour them. Users are also able to bring the burgers back to devour them as many times as they would like.

## Objective
Created a burger logging app with Handlebars, MySQL, Express, ORM, and Node.  I followed the Model-View-Controller design pattern; while using Node and MySQL to route and query data into the app. Handlebars were used to generate the Apps HTML.

## Description
This project was created using Sequelize, MySQL, Node, Express, and Handlebars. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page, once "Devoured" it will display on the right side of the page. The user has the option to "Bring it Back" and devour the same burger as many times as they want. 

## Usage
In the navbar, search "https://fast-bayou-41214.herokuapp.com/", this is the app's address on HEROKU.
